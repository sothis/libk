- pres api
	factor out the file resource abstraction from pres. this shouldn't be
	in libk, but in an external tool, as it involves special semantic
	meanings for the resource name (i.e. how it handles path name
	separators and such) in this special use case, which really shouldn't
	be handled by the library.
