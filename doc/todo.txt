- pres api
	factor out the file resource abstraction from pres. this shouldn't be
	in libk, but in an external tool, as it involves special semantic
	meanings for the resource name (i.e. how it handles path name
	separators and such) in this special use case, which really shouldn't
	be handled by the library.

- pres container handling
	it is possible that the container might be deleted while it is still
	opened by a process, the process won't get notified by the kernel
	with a lease break. we can do the following: either restore the file
	with a link() on /proc/<pid>/fd/<descriptor> before closing the
	descriptor, which requires root priviledges, or monitor the file
	with inotify and decide what to do on file deletion.
